WinoCNN combines systolic array and fast Winograd algorithm for CNN acceleration. This system supports flexible convolution kernel sizes without sacrificing DSP efficiency through various algorithmic, architecture and on-chip memory subsystem designs and optimizations. Overall, our accelerator delivers high throughput and state-of-the-art DSP efficiency compared to previous accelerator implementations.
